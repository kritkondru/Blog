<h1>Food</h1>
<br/><p>I have explored many cuisines  Mediterranean,Chinese,Indian,Thai u name it .The best out of those has been Indian .
<br/>Chicken Biryani is an amazing dish which gets two cuisines together ,the Mediterranean and Indian.
<br/>It consists of tender chicken pieces mixed with rice cooked in a steel utensil on coal.
<br/>The dish has been introduced by the Moguls when they invaded India ,ever since then has been a dish to go to for many Indians</p>
<h1>Cars</h1>
<br/><p>Cars well,what do i say .Its my dream to own a Ferrari Laferrari some day
<br/>It has a 950 hp engine,yes you heard me right 950!!!. It can go from 0-60 in 2.5 seconds and has a top speed of 349 km/hr and costs 1.4 million. Power to weight ratio is 1.65:1.
<br/>What can a person want more .So working hard until i have this beat in my garage some day is the goal. </p>
<h1>Games</h1>
<br/><p>Games, Yeah!!!!!!!,name the game and I have played them all
<br/>The game I have enjoyed playing the most is Conflict Desert Storm. Yeah yeah it is old but the best couch co-op game ever produced
<br/>And not only Desert Storm theres a part 2 to it too .The game is very interactive as we get to experience blowinng up scuds , killing terrorist groups and getting to drive some tanks and ATVs.</p>
